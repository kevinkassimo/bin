# bin
Commands created by myself under my own `bin`. On my system, it lies in `/opt/bin`

## Install
Simple. You can put this folder wherever you like, and just remember to add it to path!  

## Commands
### cpown
copy files/directories while changing ownership and group.  
```bash
# -r is implied in `cpown`
cpown [-u USR] [-g GRP] SOURCE DEST
cpown [-u USR] [-g GRP] SOURCE DIR
```
